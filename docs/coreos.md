Mesos + Marathon on CoreOS
--------------------------
A short list / group of instructions to being

  # Being up the CoreOS cluster of you haven't done so already

  $ vagrant box update
  $ vagrant up
  # Check all the machines are there
  $ export FLEETCTL_ENDPOINT=http://10.0.1.101:4001
  $ fleetctl list-machines

  # if not, run the fixup, as i've had issues with the discovery service
  $ service/coreos-fixup
  $ fleetctl list-machines

  # Lets bring up some utility services (service discovery)
  $ cd services/
  $ fleetctl start consul-master.service
  $ fleetctl start consul-slave[12].service
  $ fleetctl start registrator.service

    # Docker Service Proxy for auto-wiring of containers
    $ fleetctl start embassy.service

  # Bring up the zookeeper instance (note, this needs to be clustered at some point)
  $ fleetctl start zookeeper.service

  # Bring up the mesos-master and slaves
  # fleetctl start mesos-master.service
  # ...
  # fleetctl list-units

  # Check which machine the master is running on and then open a browser http://<IP>:5050

  # Start up the slaves
  $ fleetctl start mesos-slave.service

  # View in master ui to check when the slaves are registered and ready to use. Once there, we can bring up the marathon cluster

  $ fleetctl start marathon.service
  # Once done ... open a browser to any of the CoreOS machines: http://IP:8080 and you should be the Marathon UI.

  # There is a number of services in the services/demo directory;
    - a frontend connected to a redis cache and x number of mysql slaves
    - a backend which would be connected to a master and slave mysql
    - a database master and x number of slaves replicating

  note: All the above use the Service Proxy to auto-wire and load balancer the connections between them.
